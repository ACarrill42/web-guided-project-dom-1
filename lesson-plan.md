# DOM 1

## How to Contribute

- clone the [starter code](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/web-guided-project-dom-1).
- create a solution branch: `git checkout -b solution`.
- add this repository as a remote: `git remote add solution https://github.com/LambdaSchool/web-guided-project-dom-1-solution`
- pull from this repository's `master` branch into the `solution` branch in your local folder `git pull solution master:solution --force`.

A this point you should have a `master` branch pointing to the student's repository and a `solution` branch with the latest changes added to the solution repository.

When making changes to the `solution` branch, commit the changes and type `git push solution solution:master` to push them to this repository.

When making changes to the `master` branch, commit the changes and use `git push origin master` to push them to the student's repository.
